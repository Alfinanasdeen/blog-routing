              By building this project, you can learn the technologies so well and
              can gain practical knowledge during its implementation. You need to
              be good at HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for front-end development and
              NodeJS for back-end development. Some of the features include a
              search option, add to cart, order history, etc. which when added to
              this project adds value to it. It also needs a database system to
              store data on orders. Some of the e-commerce websites are Amazon,
              Flipkart, etc.

              The next best full-stack development project idea is creating an
              online learning app. Creating this application will help you in
              adding value to your resume. Begin by defining the platform
              objectives, selecting a suitable tech stack for both frontend and
              backend development, and designing a robust database architecture to
              store user data and course content. Implement secure user
              authentication, create an intuitive frontend using HTML, CSS, and
              JavaScript, and incorporate features for course management and
              communication among users.
